The Basilica of Bom Jesus church is one of a kind in India and is known for its exemplary baroque architecture.
Built in the year 1594 and consecrated in 1605, the building of this church coincides with the beginning of
Christianity in India. The church is located in Old Goa in Bainguinim about 10 km away from Panjim. The oldest
church in Goa, Basilica of Bom Jesus holds the remains of St. Francis Xavier, a special friend of St. Ignatius
Loyola with whom he founded the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). Even after 400 years, the remains are in a good
condition and are taken out once every decade.  A site with rich cultural and religious significance, the Basilica of
Bom Jesus has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
Literally translating to &#39;Holy Jesus&#39;, the basilica of Bom Jesus is the only church in Old Goa that is not been
plastered on the outside. The facade of the church has a triangular roofing which is delicately carved with the
initials &#39;IHS&#39;, which is an abbreviation for Jesuit emblem meaning &#39;Jesus, Saviour of Men&#39;. Inside, the floor of this
church is made of marble mosaic with precious stones, giving it a solemn appearance. The interior is embellished
with a screen that runs from the floor to the ceiling and has the image of St. Ignatius Loyola protecting an infant
Jesus. Above all is the image of the Holy Trinity, which is the most sacred symbol in Christianity. The Basilica of
Bom Jesus is over 408 years old and is open to the public every day.
