The temple of Rudreshwar is located in the Bicholim Taluka at a distance of 45 kms from Panaji. Shri Rudreshwar Temple is newly built on the site of an ancient site and is also known as the temple of Lord Shiva, where devotees go to seek blessings for themselves and their ancestors.Early in the morning, devotees flock to the temple to pay their obeisance to the deity. The temple is accessed by stairs that start near the mouth of the waterfall.

The festival of Mahashivaratri draws big crowds amongst the locals. However, the temple assumes importance as Hindus perform rites for the dead here.
