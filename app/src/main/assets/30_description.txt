Safa Masjid is one of the only two sixteenth-century Islamic monuments which managed to survive the excesses of the Inquisition. Safa Masjid  is just 2km away from Ponda, in a place known as Shahpur. The elegant structure was built in 1560 by Ibrahim Adil Shah, the Sultan of Bijapur.The mosque was the focus of attention in a fairly extensive complex of gardens and fountains which lies in ruins today. The rectangular prayer hall of the mosque rests above a high base and is capped with a pointed terracota tile roof

history
Safa Masjid, also called the Safa Shahouri Masjid is one of the oldest mosques in Goa. It was built by Ibrahim Adil Shah in 1560. Safa is Arabic for ‘Pure’ and the mosque quite rightly justifies the term. The single chambered mosque has a modest prayer room and a terracotta roof. Overall structural framework is quite similar to an olden style Portuguese home, seen in Goa till date. The star attraction of Safa Masjid is the huge laterite stone masonry tank with turquoise waters located within the mosque complex.
