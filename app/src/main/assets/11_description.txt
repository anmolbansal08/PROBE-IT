The Church of Saint Francis of Assisi is a Roman Catholic Church situated in the main square of Old Goa. The Church and Convent of St.
Francis of Assisi were established by eight Portuguese Franciscan friars who landed in Goa in 1517. After their arrival in 1517 with their
consistent efforts they constructed a small chapel with three altars and a choir. Eventually in the year 1521 the chapel was modified into a
church and dedicated to the Holy Ghost in 1602. Later the church was pulled down and the present church was constructed on the same
spot in 1616.
The west facing church has a nave with three chapels on both side, a choir on the first floor, a main altar and two other altars. Belfry and a
sacristy are on the north of main altar, today which you see the house of Archaeological Museum was actually a convent forming annexure to
the church.
