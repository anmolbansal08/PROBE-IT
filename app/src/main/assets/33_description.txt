Shri Nagesh temple is a "Swayambhu" shrine of Lord Shankar and is known for its miraculous myths. The consecration of its Shivlinga is of ancient times, the history of which is not available at present, except a reference in the folk songs. The environs known as Nagzar - had in the past a grove of 'Shami' trees. A legend has it that a cow-boy noticed that a cow from his herd used to visit the place regularly and showered its milk. This led to the discovery of the shivlinga.
