Standing tall and proud overseeing and protecting the taluka of Bardez, across the river from the capital city of Panaji, this fort was one of the first bastions of the Portuguese rulers against enemy invasion. The structure exudes majesty and grandeur and though it is not the biggest fort in Goa, it still commands respect and awe.

Pre-dating even the prestigious and much larger Fort Aguada, and situated at the narrowest point of the mouth of the Mandovi, itâ€™s skilful construction and strategic placement made this fort nearly impregnable and it was an important asset to the Portuguese colonists.

The fort has also been skilfully repaired in recent years and partly restored to its former glory. It is clearly visible, with its distinctive reddish stone walls, all the way from Panaji which lies across the Mandovi River from it.

history
Opposite the city of Panjim, lies the village of Reis Magos located on the northern bank of the Mandovi River. The village is famous for two monuments- The Reis Magos Fort and The Reis Magos Church-the first church in Bardez. Erected in the year 1551 it was mostly accommodated by viceroys and other dignitaries who arrived in Goa. It is now owned by the Government of Goa and listed under the Goa Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, and is the oldest fort in Goa.
