Construction of the fort was undertaken by the Portuguese in the year 1609 for the purpose of keeping an eye on
the movements through the waters and the nearby areas and the structure was finally complete in 1612. Since
then, precisely for over more than 400 years, the fort has stood strong (although some parts of it have been ruined)
and its magnificence remains intact.
The location where the fort was constructed was of strategic importance to the empire and provided it a great
defence base.
