history
he construction of Se Cathedral in Goa started in 1562 and ended in 1652. The hundred years spent on this construction, have indeed been well worth it, as the proud cathedral still stands tall and almost unblemished today.
It was built during the reign of King Dom Sebastiao, under the administration of the Archbishops of Goa and the ensuing rulers were charged with completing it using the monies from the Royal Treasury. It was substantially completed by 1619 but the main altars were not erected until 1652, however, it was consecrated in 1640.
