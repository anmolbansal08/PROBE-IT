Although de Albuquerque vowed to build a church in this spot when he saw his armies marching to victory, this church was not built in his lifetime. He originally constructed a hermitage on this site, which was later converted into the church which stands here today. The construction began in 1544 and took six years to complete

The architecture of this church presents features of the classic Gothic style along with Portuguese-Manueline style while the Renaissance influence is reflected in the interior vaults and decoration of the retables. In 1931, the Archaeological Committee of Goa placed a marble slab on the walls of the church with the inscription: “From this height, Afonso de Albuquerque watched the re-conquest of Goa on 25/11/1510.”

The church is built of laterite and plastered with lime mortar. The design of this church is exceedingly simple and it has been beautifully restored. The only decorations on its exterior are simple rope twist devices which celebrate the seafaring ways of the Portuguese colonists. These ropes wrapped cornice-style around the towers are very typical of the Manueline style.

The three-storied tower façade of this church is outstanding. There are buttresses built on the front corners of the church, thus giving it the look of a fortress, an air which is only enhanced by its high windows. There are two towers on the corners of the nave. The south tower contains a winding staircase that gives access to the “high choir” on the upper floor of this tower. The North tower contains within it a baptismal chapel on the lower level. The upper level is distinguished by slender columns and has round arched windows in which bells are hung.

The portico of this church is two-storied. The Gothic influences are clearly visible in the rib of the portico the roof is tiled and supported by wooden rafters.
