History, Construction and Architecture
The church dedicated to the Mother of God or Our Lady came to be built at Bardez in the 19th Century. Its foundation stone was laid on 7th February 1867 and the Saligao Church was inaugurated on November 26, 1873.

The Church building is stunningly distinctive with its jutting spires, each crowned with a cross. It has buttresses supporting its exterior walls and belfry. The courtyard of the Church contains another statue of the Mae de Deus, this one made of black stone.

Before the construction of this church, the Saligao Catholics were part of the parish church of the Holy Trinity at the neighbouring village of Nagoa. However, the Saligaokars had a vested interest in building a parish of their own. One of the parishiners, Francisco Salvador Gama Pinto went as far as to take the matter up with the Archbishop of Goa. The Archbishop, being in favour of their proposal, enlisted the aid of Major Martins, who was the Inspector of Public Works, to draw up the plans for this church.

It is said that the church was built with stones excavated from three different sites, two of them religious institutions. The black stones came from the ruins of the Mae de Deus convent in Daujim, the second lot of materials came from the Chapel of Our Lady of Victory, which was also close to ruination, while the balance was made up with stones from a nearby quarry.

The church building shows all the hallmarks of the Gothic architectural style, with its walls being supported by massive buttresses, surmounted by elegantly tapering spires. The main portal of the church is almost a full story high with a beautiful domed shape. Above this there is a niche in the façade in which resides a statue of Our Lady. This is surmounted by the belfry, which houses two bells. A dome like structure with a jutting spire completes this rather unusual façade.
