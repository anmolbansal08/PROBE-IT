One of the most popular beaches in North Goa, Baga Beach is located close to Calangute beach, around 30 Km
North of Panaji. It is so named after the &#39;Baga creek&#39; which flows into the Arabian Sea. Baga is the perfect
destination for you if you wish to witness the excellent nightlife of Goa as signature places such as Britto&#39;s, Tito&#39;s

and your wallet grumbles! Being one of the most visited beaches in the North, Baga also has a vast range of
water sports that you can try your hands at. Grab a sumptuous breakfast at Infantaria - a highly recommended
eatery, relax by the beach all day, and in the evening let the party animal in you come alive - it&#39;s all possible at

the same stretch of the shore.
