Anjunaâ€™s weekly Wednesday flea market is as much part of the Goan experience as a day on
the beach. More than three decades ago, it was conceived and created by hippies smoking
jumbo joints, convening to compare experiences on the heady Indian circuit and selling
pairs of Levi jeans or handmade jewellery to help fund the rest of their stay. These days the
market sprawls back from the beach to the entrance road in the paddy fields. For a rest from
the shopping there are chai stalls and a couple of restaurant-bars with live music. The best
time to visit is early (from 8am) or late afternoon (around 4pm till close just after sunset).
The first market of the season is around mid-November, continuing till the end of April.
