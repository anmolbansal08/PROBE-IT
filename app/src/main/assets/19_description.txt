Dating from 1627, the Convent of St. Monica that was once called 'Royal Monastery' due to the state patronage is situated opposite the St. Augustine church. It was once burned down in 1636 but was rebuilt completely the following year.

Situated next to the Convent is the Church dedicated to St. Monica, which has the famous Chapel of the Weeping Cross. The cross is believed to be miraculous and it is said that in 1636 Christ opened his eyes and blood oozed from his crown of thorns. Beside the main altar there was also a row of black faced statues known as the Black Virgins long ago. It came to be known that their black color was a result of the soot from the candles lit at their feet.

The convent is currently occupied by nuns from the Mater Dei Institute. In a renovated section of the convent of St. Monica is the Museum of Christian Art where contribution from the 16th to 19th centuries of the Hindus to Christian art is displayed. It also includes objects such as silver crowns, ivory ornaments, 17th century manuscripts and statues. It is open on all days from 9.30 am to 5 pm.

The Church of Our Lady of Rosary, one of the earliest churches in Goa is situated further down the road from the St. Monica's convent. It is said that from this high vantage point above the Mandovi, Alfonso de Albuquerque watched the battle for the conquest of Old Goa and after his victory the original church was erected by him.
