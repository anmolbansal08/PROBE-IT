One of the oldest buildings in Panaji pre-dates the invasion of the Portuguese – despite looking typically
colonial – and was the palace of Adil Shah of Bijapur. The proud building stands on the banks of the peacefully
flowing Mandovi River and is a testament to Goa’s long and varied history. Its interior was renovated by
Serendipity Arts Foundation and the Government of Goa and was opened to the public after 12 years for SAF
2016..
The royal residence built was a blend of the Hindu and also Muslim style of engineering. The Palace of Yusuf Adil Shah was a noteworthy
vacation destination of Goa until the point that it was annihilated in 1820 for development of better houses. The passage of basalt columns
holding up a flat lintel is all that is left of the once delightful royal residence today. The castle, before pulverization, was the home of the
Portuguese Governor until 1696.
