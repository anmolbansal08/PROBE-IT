Corjuem fort was built in 1550 and was originally the property of the Bhonsle rulers of Sawantwadi. However, in the time of Viceroy Caetano de Mello e Castro, the fort was annexed to the Portuguese administration of Goa. The colonists rebuilt the fort in 1705 to boost their defences of Panaji, which had by then become the capital city.

Although small, the fort had great strategic importance. During the 18th century, it held off Maratha invasions by Rane Rajput and the Bhonsles. In the early 1800â€™s the fort was used as a military school. It was armed with a small battalion of four guns and it defended the town of Corjuem


Legends
The story is told of a brave woman, a woman out of her time who was unhappy with the restrictions that were laid upon women of that era. This remarkable lady, Ursula e Lancastre, disguised herself as a man and took off to see the world. In this guise, she ended up as a soldier and was posted as one of the defenders of this fort.

Her masquerade went undetected until she was caught as a prisoner of war and stripped. Fortunately, the Captain of the Guard was impressed by her daring and valour and rather than taking harsh punitive action, courted and wed her (which was probably not as great a punishment as death would have been).
