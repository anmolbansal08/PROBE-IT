The word Kesarval comes from the Indian word for eagles. The place was so named for the eagles that used to make their nests in the cliff face near the waterfall. There are many medicinal properties attached to the waters of this spring. Young and old alike come to bathe here to wash away their ailments and rejuvenate themselves. The origins of these properties are not known however the algae found in the water are known to have some beneficial properties.

The Kesarval falls have been declared an important tourist attraction by the government of Goa, and facilities have been provided to attract more people to these reputedly healing waters. These include improving the access routes to the falls and setting up places where people can buy food, water, medicines, exchange money etc.
