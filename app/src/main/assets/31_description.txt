Sao Tome is a beautiful Latin Quarter located in Panaji on the banks of the Ourem Creek and named after the natural springs nearby. It was laid out on a piece of land acquired by a Goan in the 18th century who had made a fortune in Mozambique. The quarter is now recognised as a heritage site and is famous for its charming Portuguese style houses on the base of the Altinho hills.
