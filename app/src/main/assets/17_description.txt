The old city of Goa was called the “Rome of the East”.  In this city there existed as many as 38 churches, chapels and convents. It was the capital city of the Portuguese Empire and the centre of Christianity in the East. It is understood that today only 13 churches and chapels are standing in the Old City of Goa. The City of Old Goa is a valley in between three hills. The third hill which is called ‘Boa Vista’ (Hill of Good View) houses the church of the cross of miracles (Cruz dos Milagres). Attached to it is a huge convent of the congregation of Oratorians and the recently built St. Joseph Vaz Spiritual Renewal Centre. 
According to history in the year 1619 a miracle took place on the third hill. Some shepherds who used to graze the cattle on the hills made a cross and planted it on the hill. Red flags were miraculously seen flying above Boa Vista Hill. At night rays of bright light were seen emanating from the sky and falling on the cross. Later on a crucified human being was also seen on the cross by the locals which was unwrapped in dazzling light and the body covered with wounds. At that point of time the cross which was 3 yards tall grew to 5 yards. The news of the miraculous happening grew like wild-fire. Many sick people who came to see the phenomenon were healed of their sickness. A water-spring also gushed out at the site and more miraculous healings took place.
